# BlazorDash
A dashboard built on Blazor 0.5.1

This project is my experimentation with Blazor. If you stumble across it I hope you find it helpful.

The initial project is intended to test JS interop and contains the following:

An ASP.Net Core Hosted Blazor App (3 projects: client, server, shared)

A js world map component (echarts https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts) 

Initially random test data is used but the aim is to build a sports data analytics dashboard, football (soccer to some) focused first.

I'm also getting to know github so I'm uploading this working project in parts.
